# Absorb Textbooks like a Sponge

[Original video](https://youtu.be/nqYmmZKY4sA)

This is for each chapter in a textbook.

1. **Flip through each page.** Overview on what is coming.
2. **Look at the end questions and quizzes.** You know what to look for.
3. **Read the bold print.** Information has been broken down for you.
4. **Read the first and last sentence in a paragraph.** The first sentence is an introduction & the last a conclusion.

This method takes more time than just reading the chapter in one go, but it is way more effective.

And remember: REPETITION IS THE MOTHER OF LEARNING.
